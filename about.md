## Overview
My name is Ian Davis. I study robotics at Northwestern University, in Chicago. I will be completing my Master's degree on the 15th of December. 
As a robotics engineer it is important to me that I not overspecialize in any one area of expertise. My interests are focused on mobile robotic systems, such as quad copter drones or NASA's Curiosity rover, and wearable devices that enhance human ability, such as advanced prosthetics or my own mag-sense project. I look forward to using these interest areas as platforms to hone and expand my skills as an engineer.
