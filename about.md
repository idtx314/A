## Overview
My name is Ian Davis. At the moment I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Robotics from Northwestern University in Illinois. It is my intention to combine this very different training with the existing foundations that I laid while earning my Bachelor's in Molecular and Cell Biology in order to take a broad, user centric approach to the design of robotic and mechatronic devices. 

After I complete my Master's I will work to advance the field of Human/Robot interaction by conducting research and developing products, such as neuro-prosthetic devices, that restore and expand human capability.


### Research interests
* Neural Interfaces
* Human/Machine Interaction
