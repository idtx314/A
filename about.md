## Overview
My name is Ian Davis.  

I have a passion for making metal move, and I enjoy applying my expertise in mechatronics and embedded systems to create machines that amplify the potential of the people that work with them.  

I graduated from Northwestern University's Master of Science in Robotics program in December of 2018 and have been working diligently to become a professional engineer in the Aerospace or Medical Device industries.
