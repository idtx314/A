## Overview
A self-assigned project to reduce workload and increase efficiency by standardizing sample submission containers, made complex by the need to communicate with and smoothly onboard hundreds of existing customers.

### Implementation
After determining the project to be feasible, I spearheaded this effort by actively engaging and coordinating staff and management resources, setting timelines, producing publicity material, acquiring feedback from our customer base, producing solutions for the major anticipated issues, and guiding our handling of customer relations during implementation.

### Outcome
The project ultimately reduced processing time by about a half hour per plate, a total of 2.5 worker-hours per day.
