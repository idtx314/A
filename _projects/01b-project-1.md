<!-- The introduction will briefly explain why the project mattered and what was accomplished -->
## Introduction
Motivation: [This paragraph should justify the importance of the project, whether it was undertaken to revolutionize a field or expand my skills.]  
Goal: The Goal of the project was [Concrete list of objectives].  
Outcome: Over what period of [project time span], I have been able to [project accomplishments in list or paragraph form].  

On the basis of complaints from Jarvis, the layout of this section should change to something more like 
    What I did:
    Why it's interesting:
I haven't perfected the "why it's interesting" part, but the other one is similar to shaving down the introduction to just the Outcome section.

<!-- The body will typically consist of a Hardware and Software component, along with sub-components of each -->
## Main Component
This should be a high level description of the component and how it was created. Materials, programming languages, and a breakdown of major functions should go here. If more than one major function or piece of hardware is involved then detailed description should be moved into a sub-component section.
<br />
<br />
>
>#### Sub-Component
>A more detailed description of what this sub-component is responsible for doing, how it was designed, and why major design choices where made.
